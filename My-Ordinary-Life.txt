Hi my fellow friends or simply coders!

My name is Mohammad Sameer and I made this 
repo to help all the upcoming class 12 students
who aspire to build their career in computer science.

Sorry for class 11 students - I'm not able to make the specific repo for you all 
as class 12th's first 2 chapters cover most part of class 11.

Here you'll find:
- Notes
- PYQs (Previous Year Questions)
- Tough questions on each chapter
- More sections will be added in future

I hope this repo gets 100 stars - then my purpose will be fulfilled. 
I am also a class 12 student while I started working on this repo.

For any student or coder who wants to collaborate and help me manage and update the repo, 
contact me through my social media handles. 

Anyone feel free to fork and make changes like improving notes and adding new updated questions. 
I will definitely review your pull requests!
